      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Undelivered Shipment Protocol</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This Undelivered Shipment Protocol ("Protocol") applies to instances of Undelivered Shipments (as defined below). Any capitalized terms used herein and not explicitly defined shall bear the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Use, as may be updated from time to time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-left">I. Delivery Attempts to Buyer:</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        OnSourcd (referred to as "OnSourcd", "we", or "us") or our designated logistics partner will endeavour to deliver the Shipment to the Buyer a maximum of two (2) attempts within 24 hours. However, delivery attempts will be limited to a total of two (2) if any of the following circumstances occur:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Consignee refuses to accept the Shipment during any of the delivery attempts.</li>
        <li>Consignee's address cannot be located after two (2) delivery attempts.</li>
        <li>Buyer requests OnSourcd to hold the Shipment.</li>
        <li>Unavailability of unloading facility or labor.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If OnSourcd receives a request from the Buyer to postpone Shipment delivery, we may accommodate such requests for a maximum of 24 hours from the initial delivery attempt, subject to availability and circumstances. OnSourcd reserves the right to accept or decline such requests at our discretion. Should we decline the request, the Shipment will be classified as an Undelivered Shipment in accordance with this Protocol.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Despite our diligent efforts to deliver the Shipment to the Buyer, delivery failures may occur due to various reasons, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Consignee refusal of delivery.</li>
        <li>Consignee unavailability at the delivery address.</li>
        <li>Insufficient funds for payment upon delivery.</li>
        <li>Consignee unreachability or requests for future delivery attempts.</li>
        <li>Circumstances outlined in paragraph (I) above.</li>
        <li>Other scenarios beyond our reasonable control.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        OnSourcd may impose a ‘Transportation and Loading/Unloading fee’ (if applicable) in cases outlined in points 1-6 above, where the Shipment is marked as an Undelivered Shipment due to the Buyer's failure to accept it.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In certain exceptional situations, such as incorrect delivery addresses or non-serviceable locations, where delivery is not feasible due to unforeseen circumstances or service unavailability, such Shipments will be classified as Undelivered Shipments under this Protocol.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-left">II. Return of Undelivered Shipment to the Seller:</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Undelivered Shipments will be returned to the Seller in their original condition. We will aim to return Undelivered Shipments to the Seller. The Pick-Up Date refers to the date of the Shipment's collection from the Seller for delivery to the Buyer.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If there are delays in returning Undelivered Shipments to the Seller due to force majeure events or circumstances beyond our control, updated delivery timelines will be communicated to the Seller. Upon accepting the delivery of Undelivered Shipments, the Seller or their representative must sign and affix the company/LLP/firm seal on the Proof of Delivery ("POD").
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        During the receipt of Undelivered Shipments, please note:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Sellers must not detain our field executives or our Delivery partner under any circumstances.</li>
        <li>Sellers must promptly report any tampering, pilferage, or damage to the Shipment on the POD and raise concerns on the Platform or our helpline number within the specified timelines.</li>
        <li>Our executives will not wait for more than 20 minutes at the Seller's premises after unloading.</li>
        <li>If the Seller indicates on the POD that the Undelivered Shipment is tampered or damaged, our executive may request the Seller to open the Shipment to verify the claim.</li>
        <li>Sellers are obligated to accept the delivery of Return to Origin (RTO) Shipments. However, if the Seller refuses delivery or if the Seller is not available at the location, OnSourcd will make a maximum of two (2) additional delivery attempts within 24 hours.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-left">III. Refusal of Undelivered Shipment by the Seller:</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If after two (2) attempts to deliver the Undelivered Shipment to the Seller, the Seller refuses delivery or OnSourcd is unable to deliver the Undelivered Shipment, OnSourcd reserves the right to move the Undelivered Shipment to our liquidation hub and liquidate or dispose of it as deemed fit in our sole discretion.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        OnSourcd will not be liable to refund the invoice value of the Shipment or transfer any proceeds from the liquidation to the Seller. Any claims brought by the Seller regarding such Undelivered Shipments will not be entertained, and the Seller acknowledges that they are not entitled to any funds from the liquidation of such Undelivered Shipments.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-left">IV. Claims Process by the Seller:</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        If the Seller discovers that an Undelivered Shipment is damaged, tampered with, or not in good condition, the Seller must note such details on the POD and raise concerns within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving the Undelivered Shipment. Failure to do so will deem the Undelivered Shipment as accepted by the Seller without damage or fault. Claims raised beyond this timeframe will not be entertained.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Any POD without the Seller's or their representatives' signatures and company/LLP/firm seal will not be considered for investigating or validating claims.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Should it be found that the Seller consistently marks every Undelivered Shipment as 'damage/doubtful/tampered' on the POD, irrespective of actual condition, OnSourcd reserves the right to reject such claims. Our decision in this matter is final and binding on the Seller.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Seller concerns/grievances regarding Undelivered Shipments should be directed to our customer support.

      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
